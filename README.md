# FullStack-SPA
- Creating a Single Page Web Application that uses Angular as front-end and .NET as back-end.
- The project's back-end architecture is ASP.NET MVC.
- The project uses a local SQL server that is going to be deployed on the cloud.
- The intention of this project is to practice Object Oriented Design by creating a clean full stack architecture, using dependency injection (Entity Framework), creating REST API's, and implementing Authentication. 
-  I will be performing Unit Testing and eventually host the project on AWS.

- Objectives:
Creating and configuring the Angular project.
Creating get and post routes in an ASP.NET Core controller - CRUD operations.
Updating Angular service to post to API.
Persistence with Entity Framework.
Displaying and editing data in Angular with ASP.NET Core.
Creating forms and navigating to different views in Angular.
Associations between entities with Angular and Entity Framework.
Setting up Identity Framework and 3rd Party Authentication.
