# FullStack-SPA
- Creating a Single Page Web Application that uses Angular as front-end and .NET as back-end.
- The project's back-end architecture is ASP.NET MVC.
- The project uses a local SQL server that is going to be deployed on the cloud.
- The intention of this project is to practice Object Oriented Design by creating a clean full stack architecture, using dependency injection (Entity Framework), creating REST API's, and implementing Authentication. 
-  I will be performing Unit Testing and eventually host the project on AWS.
